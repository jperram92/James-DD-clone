Online D&D-Style Game (Web-Based) — Architecture & Engineering Plan

🎯 Project Overview

Build a real-time, multiplayer Dungeons & Dragons-style game that runs in the browser, supports webcam and mic interaction between players, and includes gameplay mechanics like character creation, campaign management, dice rolling, and turn-based encounters. The system will be built using React (TypeScript) for frontend, Supabase for backend services (auth, DB, storage), and LiveKit or Daily.co for WebRTC video/audio.

🛠️ Potential Issues & Solutions (Top 50 Considerations)

#

Potential Issue

Solution

1

Video lag or jitter during gameplay

Prioritize bandwidth use with audio-only fallback and dynamic bitrate adjustment (LiveKit supports this)

2

Players disconnecting mid-session

Implement session persistence with reconnection logic and reconnect prompts

3

WebRTC browser compatibility

Use a tested SDK like LiveKit or Daily with fallbacks and polyfills

4

Supabase Realtime hitting limits

Throttle less critical updates or batch changes

5

Long campaign loading times

Use lazy-loading and chunked DB requests

6

Fog of War sync issues

Use atomic updates and optimistic rendering with rollback on conflict

7

Players tampering with game state (e.g. HP edits)

Use Supabase RLS policies to restrict writes only to owner or DM

8

Audio echo or feedback

Enable WebRTC echo cancellation and UI for mic testing

9

Browser crashes lose unsaved character edits

Use localStorage backup and periodic auto-save to Supabase

10

Campaign links leaking publicly

Add one-time or expiring invite tokens

11

Chat spam or abuse

Add cooldown between messages and profanity filtering

12

Dice roll cheating

Use server-trusted rolls only, synced via Supabase and rendered on all clients

13

Turn order desync

Use Supabase subscriptions to broadcast authoritative turn updates

14

Confusing UI for new players

Add onboarding modal/tutorial walkthrough

15

Session limits on free Daily plan

Monitor API usage and allow switching to self-hosted LiveKit

16

Image asset upload errors

Validate size and type client-side before Supabase upload

17

Unresponsive campaign view

Debounce state updates and lazy-load maps/tokens

18

API key exposure in client

Use Supabase Edge Functions to generate secure tokens

19

Broken map tiles on reload

Cache map state in browser and retry missing chunks

20

Audio/mic access denied

Add browser permission troubleshooting wizard

21

Browser refresh during encounter

Store in-session state in Supabase for recovery

22

Players editing other characters

Enforce RLS on characters table by user_id

23

Laggy animations

Use framer-motion with layout spring config for smoother transitions

24

Token position flickering

Use conflict-free replicated positions and timestamps

25

Players talking over each other

Add voice visual indicators to identify active speakers

26

Non-mobile-friendly controls

Implement responsive UI with gesture support

27

Unauthorized users joining rooms

Use Supabase-generated room tokens with validation

28

Players losing track of initiative

Use persistent turns table and highlighted visual cues

29

Inaccessible for screen readers

Use proper ARIA labels and alt tags for all major UI components

30

Character sheet edits not saving

Add validation, auto-save, and update feedback

31

State sync conflicts (e.g. two edits at once)

Implement last-write-wins or conflict resolution modal

32

Overloaded Supabase storage

Prune unused campaigns/images or prompt DM cleanup

33

Session audio recording request

Provide opt-in toggle and store audio as blob in Supabase Storage

34

Users switching roles mid-campaign

Provide UI for DM to promote/demote roles and enforce permissions

35

Unauthorized dice rerolls

Add button cooldown and roll audit logs

36

No backup system

Implement daily cron export of all campaign data to Supabase Storage bucket

37

App fails offline

Enable offline character sheet cache and reconnect logic for chat/game state

38

Language barriers

Use Supabase extension or client-side i18n for multilingual support

39

No campaign archive

Allow export/import to JSON or static campaign snapshot

40

Webcam feed fails mid-game

Provide fallback to avatar and text-only chat

41

DMs want campaign templates

Allow saving map/character setups as campaign blueprints

42

Incompatible file uploads

Restrict uploads by extension/size and auto-resize on client

43

Unclear rule enforcement

Let DMs toggle optional rules (e.g., advantage, crit fail)

44

Session bloated with unused logs

Auto-delete chat/dice logs older than X days unless bookmarked

45

Scaling beyond free tier

Warn users when usage nears quota and offer export-to-self-hosting

46

Device/browser-specific bugs

Use Sentry or LogRocket to track client errors per platform

47

Token overlap/grid misalignment

Snap-to-grid logic with collision detection

48

Supabase rate-limiting

Use batching, debouncing, and consider Edge Functions for heavy ops

49

Low webcam/mic quality

Let players adjust video/audio quality in-game settings

50

Abandoned campaigns

Implement auto-archive after X weeks of inactivity
