## Code Quality & Architecture
- [ ] 21. **Implement Stricter TypeScript Config**: Enable stricter TypeScript checks for better type safety.
- [ ] 22. **Add Storybook**: Implement Storybook for component documentation and visual testing.
- [ ] 23. **Implement API Layer Abstraction**: Create a dedicated API layer to centralize Supabase calls.
- [ ] 24. **Add Error Boundary Components**: Implement React Error Boundaries to prevent app crashes.
- [ ] 25. **Enhance State Management**: Consider using React Query for server state management alongside Zustand.

## User Experience
- [ ] 26. **Add Loading States**: Implement consistent loading states across the application.
- [ ] 27. **Enhance Form Validation**: Add more robust form validation with better error messages.
- [ ] 28. **Implement Guided Onboarding**: Add a tutorial or guided onboarding for new users.
- [ ] 29. **Add Offline Mode**: Implement basic offline functionality with data synchronization.
- [ ] 30. **Enhance Mobile Responsiveness**: Improve the mobile experience with responsive design.

## Feature Enhancements
